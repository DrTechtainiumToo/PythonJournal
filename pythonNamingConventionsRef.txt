PEP 8:

General Naming Guidelines
Use clear, descriptive names; avoid single-letter variables except for counters or iterators in small loops.
Avoid names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a balance between the two.

Variables
Use lowercase single letters, words, or words separated by underscores.
Example: counter, employee_name

Functions and Methods
Use lowercase words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Example: calculate_salary, send_message

Constants
Use uppercase letters with underscores separating words.
Example: MAX_OVERFLOW, TOTAL_EMPLOYEES

Classes
Use the CapWords convention, also known as CamelCase. Each word starts with a capital letter with no underscores between them.
Example: BankAccount, EmployeeRecord

Modules and Packages
Use short, lowercase names, and if improved readability requires it, use underscores.
Modules: calculator.py, db_utils.py
Packages: Avoid using underscores if possible.

Special Names
Double leading and trailing underscores (__) are reserved for special methods and variables, known as "dunder" methods, like __init__ for constructors or __str__ for string representations.

Private or "Internal" Use
Use a single leading underscore (_) to indicate a non-public method or attribute.
Example: _internal_helper, _cache

Avoiding Conflicts with Python Keywords
Append a single trailing underscore to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.
Example: class_, from_

Type Variables (PEP 484)
Use CapWords preferring short names: T, AnyStr, Num. It's often better to add suffixes _co or _contra to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly.
